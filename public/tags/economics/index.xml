      <description>&lt;p&gt;The guild will be able to manage project budgets via multi-signature cryptocurrency wallets. For example, if the organization has 9 code reviewers, a 5 of 9 multisig Bitcoin wallet could be created, and a majority of the reviewers would need to sign off on any payments. To continue the example, a developer could submit a pull request in response to a bounty. If 5 of the 9 reviewers agree that the pull request is satisfactory, the payment will be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-coding roles such as testers, project managers, and code reviewers can be defined in the charter, and the individuals rewarded according to the fulfilment of their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the specific jobs and their value should be determined on a case-by-case basis, the theoretical idea is that some small and manageable amount of value will be awarded to anyone performing quality, peer-reviewed, open source work. Specific jobs will be created on the network, similar to Dash&amp;rsquo;s Masternodes, which will be responsible for this peer-review. Other specialized tasks such as editing and documentation can be similarly counted, reviewed, and rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent all of this activity is documented in peer-reviewable commits, the contributors will all be rewarded with the Bitcoins held in escrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peer-review model will incentivize higher quality of work for guild contracts, as well as a highly meritocratic arbitration body. Theoretically, this peer-review model and Git Guild could be used in any profession that can track their work through Git or a similarly digitized and signed mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a client wants to sponsor specific enhancements or bug fixes to the project, the funding would be deposited into the guild&amp;rsquo;s treasury via a P2SH bitcoin address. From then on, the guild will manage the funds and execution of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No venture capitalists, incorporation, or contact with meatspace is required.&lt;/p&gt;
