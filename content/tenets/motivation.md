Open source projects are notoriously hard to monetize and organize. "Herding cats" is an analogy often heard. Conversely, corporate bureaucracy is often an expensive externality which can undermine the founding principles of a software project.

The emergence of cryptographic implements, such as [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) and [Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page), have created a new paradigm which enables the minimization of resource intensive externalities and allows individuals leading open source projects to focus on code quality.

Git Guild is a meritocractic governance model focused on improving the organization and monetization of open source software development. Git Guild is a means to enable transparency, accountability, quality control and renumeration between freely associating individuals.
